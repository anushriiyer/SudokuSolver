# Sudoku Solver
This solver uses the application of brute-force algorithm (recursion) to solve sudoku puzzles of 3 difficulty levels and uses a set sudoku matrix of 9x9. The sudoku grids are entered in the following fashion where 0 represents a blank space.

            [[0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 6],
             [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 0],
             [2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 1, 5],
             [0, 8, 4, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0],
             [7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9],
             [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 8, 0],
             [6, 9, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8],
             [0, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
             [4, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0]]
