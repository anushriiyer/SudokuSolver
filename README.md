## Solver
This solver uses the application of brute-force algorithm (recursion) to solve sudoku puzzles of 3 difficulty levels. It asks the user to choose their level of difficulty and gives them 2 minutes to solve the question before displaying the solved solution. The sudoku grids are entered in the following fashion where 0 represents a blank space.

            [[0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 6],                   5  .  7  2  .  .  .  9  .
             [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 0],                   .  .  6  .  3  .  7  .  1
             [2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 1, 5],                   4  .  .  .  .  .  .  6  .
             [0, 8, 4, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0],                   1  .  .  4  9  .  .  .  7
